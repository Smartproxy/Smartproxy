If you want to continue development with Ruby we highly recommend reading their [documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/).

### Prerequisites

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

### Installation

Once you have Ruby installed, continue with the following steps in Command Prompt/Terminal:

1. Create your project directory, if you are using a command line, you can simply do that using `mkdir ruby_example` command.
2. Navigate to your project folder using `cd ruby_example` command.
3. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:
