### Disclaimer

If you want to continue development with Golang we highly recommend reading their [documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

### Prerequisites

* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with GO, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilising `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/golang/golang.go > golang.go`

3. You should see a new file named `golang.go` in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To setup your username, password and endpoint you would like to use, change the according line in within punctuation marks ('').

### Usage

To execute the GO example, simply write `go run golang.go`

If you did everything correctly, you should see IP details from the target website appearing in your Terminal/Command Prompt.
