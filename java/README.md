### Disclaimer

To continue further development with Java, make sure to read their [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/)

### Prerequisites

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Java SE Runtime Environment 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

### Installation

This particular code was built with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) which will be used to build and launch the application.

If you feel like using something else or executing the script with `javac` command, you may need to install [JAVA JRE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/server-jre8-downloads-2133154.html).

Once you have all the prerequisites ready, create your project folder:

```
mkdir java_example
```
When project directory is setup, you can now download our example code for Java.

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt window.
2. Navigate to the main directory of your project folder using `cd java_example`
3. Download our code using the following command:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/java/java.java > java.java
```

4. You should now see your project folder populated with *java.java* file.

### Configuration

To configure the proxy, simply change the arrow marked lines in the code:
