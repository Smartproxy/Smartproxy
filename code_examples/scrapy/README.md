### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script showing how to utilize Smartproxy with Scrapy.
We suggest to reseach [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Prerequisites

To get started with Scrapy you will first need to install it using methods provided in their documentation. [Check here for more information](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html)

### Installation

Once you get Scrapy up and running if you have not yet, make sure that you create your project folder

```
scrapy startproject yourprojectname
```

When project directory is setup, you can now copy our test spider code: 


1. Create smartproxy_spider.py file in .\yourprojectname\yourprojectname\spiders\ directory.
2. Copy the code from our [repository](https://github.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/blob/master/code-examples/scrapy/smartproxy_spider.py).
3. Run the script using `scrapy crawl smartproxy` command.

### How to check if it works?

As mentioned this script only sends a basic request to a certain website to check what IP address is currently visiting it.

If you done all the steps correctly, you should see the result as `{'ip': '\nYour Public IPv4 is: XX.XX.XX.XX'}` along with other actions performed by Scrapy in the Terminal window.
