### Disclaimer

The provided example code is only to show basic authentication through proxy while sending requests with PHP. If you want to continue develompent with this tool we highly recommend reading their [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/).

### Prerequisites

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with PHP, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilising `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

For HTTP(S) `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/php/php.php > php.php`
For SOCKS5 `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/php/php.php > phpsocks5h.php`

3. You should see a new file named php.php in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To setup your username, password and endpoint you would like to use, change the according line in within punctuation marks ('').

### Usage

To run the following example you will need a HTTP Server.

Once you have it setup you can access your file with the path it has been stored to on your server. For example `http://localhost/php.php`

If you did everything correctly, you should see an IP appearing form our proxy server once you open the website.
